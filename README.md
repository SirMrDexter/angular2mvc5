# Sample Angular 2 RC1 and Mvc 5 application.
A simple application showing how to configure a mvc5 project to support angular2 (with typescript).

Cloned from codeplex (http://angular2mvc5.codeplex.com/)
## Installation Issues :
*Required:* Visual Studio 2015 Update 2

[Synchronize Node.JS Install Version with Visual Studio 2015](http://ryanhayes.net/synchronize-node-js-install-version-with-visual-studio-2015/)
### Correct this issue
If using npm behind a proxy rename file "_typingsrc" with ".typingsrc" and configure it.

If package restoration problems occur, restore packages manually with the " npm i" command and check logs.
